Some explanation:
=================
We have three sources of information about the density and type of bulk gas (a.k.a. collision partner) species: (i) the number of elements returned by the density() function; (ii) the list par->collPartIds; (iii) and the transition rate values supplied in the moldatfiles. What we want to do is associate density functions with collision partners given in the moldatfiles. We would like to do this if possible without deviating from the original assumptions made in the earliest versions of LIME, and without loading the user down with too much crud.

Below is given a typical timeline of processing within LIME, showing for each stage the questions which the code asks about par->collPartIds and the moldatfiles, and the decisions taken in response.

main.initParImg():
------------------

  - inpars->collPartIds (i.e. a struct of type 'inputPars') is malloc'd to size MAX_N_COLL_PART and all the entries are set to 0. Zero does not correspond with any LAMDA species and can therefore be used to flag that the user has not reset the value to something sensible.

User's model file:
------------------

  - (optionally) some enties of inpars->collPartIds are set to >0 values.

run.parseInput():
-----------------

  par->collPartIds (a struct of type 'configInfo') is malloc'd to size MAX_N_COLL_PART and the inpars values are copied over.

collparts.checkUserDensWeights():
---------------------------------

  - The number of >0 (therefore user-set) values of par->collPartIds are counted. Counting starts from the 0th element and stops as soon as the first <=0 value is found.

  - The number of user-set values of par->collPartIds is compared to the number of density() function returns (by now stored in par->numDensities). If the numbers are unequal, par->collPartIds is freed and set to NULL (a warning is issued if the user set some values). If the numbers match, par->collPartIds is reallocated in size to that number (this is possibly unnecessary).

  - If the user has supplied par->collPartNames, with the number of entries correctly matching the number of density() returns (par->numDensities), in the case that par->collPartIds was set to NULL just above, then par->collPartIds is malloc'd to size par->numDensities; it is loaded then with an increasing sequence of integers.

  - par->collPartIds, if set, are checked for uniqueness.

molinit.readMolData():
----------------------

  - The collision partners listed in the set of moldatfiles are read from file. Here we first want to compile a list of unique (that is, without repetition) collision partners that occur in the files. We will only do this however if either (i) the user has supplied no values of par->collPartIds or (ii) the collision partner matches one supplied in par->collPartIds.

  - Note that ALL collision partners read from the ith file are stored in md[i].part.

collparts.setUpDensityAux():
----------------------------

  - The processing in this looks quite complicated, but the only thing that is done to par->collPartIds is if it ==NULL: it is then malloc'd to size par->numDensities and, under limited circumstances, its values are set to those read from the moldatfiles.

molinit.assignMolCollPartsToDensities():
----------------------------------------

  - par->collPartIds is compared here to the collision partner IDs in md[i].part[ipart].collPartId. If a CP is found in par->collPartIds but not in md[i].part, no action is taken. If any md[i].part[ipart].collPartId is not found in par->collPartIds, md[i].part[ipart].densityIndex is set to -1. This flags to solver.getFixedMatrix() to ignore the respective transition rates.

  /*
This deals with four user-settable list parameters which relate to collision partners and their number densities: par->collPartIds, par->nMolWeights, par->collPartMolWeights and par->collPartNames. We have to see if these (optional) parameters were set, do some basic checks on them, and if they were set make sure they match the number of density values, which by this time should be stored in par->numDensities.

	* par->collPartIds: this list acts as a link between the N density function returns (I'm using here N as shorthand for par->numDensities) and the M collision partner ID integers found in the moldatfiles. This allows us to associate density functions with the collision partner transition rates provided in the moldatfiles.

	* par->collPartNames: essentially this has only cosmetic importance since it has no effect on the functioning of LIME, only on the names of the collision partners which are printed to stdout. Its main purpose is to reassure the user who has provided transition rates for a non-LAMDA collision species in their moldatfile that they are actually getting these values and not some mysterious reversion to LAMDA.

	The user can specify either, none, or both of these two parameters, with the following effects:

		Ids	Names	Effect
		----------------------
		0	0	LAMDA collision partners are assumed and the association between the density functions and the moldatfiles is essentially guessed.

		0	1	par->collPartIds is constructed to contain integers in a sequence from 1 to N. Naturally the user should write matching collision partner ID integers in their moldatfiles.

		1	0	LAMDA collision partners are assumed.

		1	1	User will get what they ask for.
		----------------------

	* par->collPartMolWeights: this MUST be present if par->collPartNames has been supplied, and it MUST then have the same number and order of elements as all the other collision-partner lists. If this parameter is supplied but par->collPartNames not, it will be ignored.

	* par->nMolWeights: this list gives the weights to be applied to the N density values when calculating molecular densities from abundances.
