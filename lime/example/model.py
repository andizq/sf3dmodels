  #    Setting elements of the following two arrays is optional. NOTE
  #    that, if you do set any of their values, you should set as many as
  #    the number of elements returned by your function density(). The
  #    ith element of the array in question will then be assumed to refer
  #    to the ith element in the density function return. The current
  #    maximum number of elements allowed is 7, which is the number of
  #    types of collision partner recognized in the LAMBDA database.
  #
  #    Note that there is no (longer) a hard connection between the
  #    number of density elements and the number of collision-partner
  #    species named in the moldata files. This means in practice that,
  #    if you set the values for par->collPartIds, you can, if you like,
  #    set some for which there are no transition rates supplied in the
  #    moldatfiles. This might happen for example if there is a molecule
  #    which contributes significantly to the total molecular density but
  #    for which there are no measured collision rates for the radiating
  #    species you are interested in.
  #
  #    You may also omit to mention in par->collPartIds a collision
  #    partner which is specified in the moldatfiles. In this case LIME
  #    will assume the density of the respective molecules is zero.
  #
  #    If you don't set any values for any or all of these arrays,
  #    i.e. if you omit any mention of them here (we preserve this
  #    possibility for purposes of backward compatibility), LIME will
  #    attempt to replicate the algorithms employed in version 1.5, which
  #    involve guessing which collision partner corresponds to which
  #    density element. Since this was not exactly a rigorous procedure,
  #    we recommend use of the arrays.
  #
  #    par->nMolWeights: this specifies how you want the number density
  #    of each radiating species to be calculated. At each grid point a
  #    sum (weighted by par->nMolWeights) of the density values is made,
  #    then this is multiplied by the abundance to return the number
  #    density.
  #

  #    7 types of collision partner.
