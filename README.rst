SF3dmodels is a star forming region(s) modelling package that brings together
analytical models in order to compute their physical properties in a 3-Dimensional grid. 
The package can couple different models in a single grid to recreate complex star
forming systems as those being revealed by current instruments. 
The output data can be read with `LIME <https://lime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ (see below) 
or `RADMC-3D <http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d/>`_ 
to carry out radiative transfer calculations of the modelled region.

Documentation
-------------

Find the full documentation and examples at the `ReadTheDocs <http://star-forming-regions.readthedocs.io>`_ website.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7.x or Python 3.5.x (or later)
* `Astropy <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/install.html>`__
* `Numpy <https://www.scipy.org/install.html>`_
* `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html>`_
* `IPython <https://ipython.org/install.html>`_ (optional, but recommended)

Installation
------------

From source
***********

Clone the star-forming-regions repository from `GitHub <https://github.com/andizq/star-forming-regions>`_:

To clone the package, if you have a github account:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone git@github.com:andizq/star-forming-regions.git

if you don't have one:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/andizq/star-forming-regions.git

Get into the star-forming-regions cloned folder and run the ``setup.py`` script in installation mode:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd star-forming-regions
   $ python setup.py install

You can test whether the installation was successful by running a example from **star-forming-regions/examples**.

Upgrade the package
*******************
   
.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ cd star-forming-regions
   $ git fetch --all
   $ git reset --hard origin/master
   $ git submodule update --force --remote -- lime
   $ python setup.py install

Uninstall
*********

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ pip uninstall sf3dmodels


LIME in *sf3dmodels* mode
-------------------------

The package contains the standard LIME v1.9.5 + an additional feature for **sf3dmodels** users. 
An ingestor was included within the LIME source codes, it allows the user to employ the **sf3dmodels** output as the LIME input. 

Installation
************

LIME must be configured separately once the **sf3dmodels** package has been installed with success. 

The installation procedure of this LIME is identical to its standard installation 
(have a look at the `LIME installation notes <https://github.com/andizq/lime/tree/sf3dmodels>`_ section). Make 
sure you are configuring and setting everything in/to the LIME directory included in this repository.

Running it
**********

The ingestor will look for the ``.dat`` files generated by **sf3dmodels** and load them within the LIME environment. 
To invoke this option, a ``-S`` flag (uppercase) must be added in the usual LIME running command as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ lime -S model.c

The standard LIME command line options may also be invoked. For instance, to set LIME to 
(1.) produce normal output rather than the default ncurses output style, (2.)  
read the **sf3dmodels** output and (3.) run in parallel mode with 4 threads 
you should execute:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ lime -nS -p 4 model.c


*Note* that if the ``-S`` option *is not set* you will get back the 'traditional' operation of LIME.

LIME Examples
*************

Take a look at the folder ``lime/example_sf3dmodels/`` included in this repository.
