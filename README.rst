SF3dmodels is a star forming region(s) modelling package that brings together
analytical models in order to compute their physical properties in a 3-dimensional grid. 
The package can couple different models in a single grid to recreate complex star
forming systems as those being revealed by current instruments. 
The output data can be read with `LIME <https://lime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ (see below) 
or `RADMC-3D <http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d/>`_ 
to carry out radiative transfer calculations of the modelled region.


Requirements
------------

* `Astropy <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/install.html>`__
* `Numpy <https://www.scipy.org/install.html>`_
* `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html>`_
* `IPython <https://ipython.org/install.html>`_ (optional, but recommended)

Installation (from source)
--------------------------

`Download`_ or clone the star-forming-regions repository from `GitHub <https://github.com/andizq/star-forming-regions>`_:

To clone the package, if you have a github account:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone git@github.com:andizq/star-forming-regions.git

if you don't have one:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/andizq/star-forming-regions.git

Using the command line, go into the folder and run the ``setup.py`` installation script:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd /path/to/local/star-forming-regions/
   $ python setup.py install


LIME in *sf3dmodels* mode
-------------------------

The package includes the standard LIME v1.9.5 + an additional feature for ``sf3dmodels`` users. 
We included an ingestor in the LIME source codes that allows the user to employ the ``sf3dmodels`` output as the LIME input. 

Installation
============
LIME must be configured separately once the ``sf3dmodels`` package has been installed with success. 

The installation procedure of this LIME is identical to its standard installation 
(have a look at the LIME `installation <https://github.com/andizq/lime/tree/sf3dmodels>`_ notes section).

Please make sure you are configuring and setting everything in/to the LIME directory included in this repository.

Running it
==========

The ingestor will look for the ``.dat`` files generated by ``sf3dmodels`` and load them within the LIME environment. 
To invoke this option, a ``-S`` flag (in capital letter) must be added in the usual LIME running command as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ lime -S model.c

The LIME standard command line options may be invoked too. For instance, to run LIME in a 
non-interactive mode and to read the ``sf3dmodels`` output as well you should run:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ lime -n -S model.c


*Note* that if the ``-S`` option *is not set* you will get back to the standard operation of LIME.

Examples
========

Check the ``example_sf3dmodels/`` folder included in ``lime/``.
