sf3dmodels is a star forming region(s) modelling package that brings together
analytical models in order to compute their physical properties in a 3-Dimensional grid. 
The package can couple different models in a single grid to recreate complex star
forming systems as those being revealed by current data. 
The output data can be read with `LIME`_ or `RADMC-3D`_
to carry out radiative transfer calculations of the model.

Requirements
============

* Python 2.7.x or 3.5.x (or later)
* `Astropy <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/install.html>`__
* `Numpy <https://www.scipy.org/install.html>`_
* `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html>`_
* `IPython <https://ipython.org/install.html>`_ (optional, but recommended)

Installation
============

From source
-----------

Clone the star-forming-regions repository from `GitHub`_:

To clone the package, if you have a github account:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:andizq/star-forming-regions.git

if you don't have one:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/andizq/star-forming-regions.git

Get into the star-forming-regions cloned folder and run the **setup.py** script in installation mode:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd star-forming-regions
   python setup.py install

You can test whether the installation was successful by running a example from **star-forming-regions/examples**.

Upgrade the package
-------------------
   
.. code-block:: bash
   
   cd star-forming-regions
   git fetch --all
   git reset --hard origin/master
   git submodule update --force --remote -- lime
   python setup.py install

Uninstall
---------

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip uninstall sf3dmodels

LIME in *sf3dmodels* mode
=========================

The package contains the standard LIME v1.9.5 + an additional feature for **sf3dmodels** users. 
An ingestor was included within the LIME source codes, it allows the user to employ the **sf3dmodels** output as the LIME input. 

Installation
------------

LIME must be configured separately once the **sf3dmodels** package has been installed with success. 

The installation procedure of this LIME is identical to its standard installation 
(have a look at the `LIME installation notes <https://github.com/andizq/lime/tree/sf3dmodels>`_ section). Make 
sure you are configuring and setting everything in/to the LIME directory included in this repository.

Running it
----------

The ingestor will look for the ``.dat`` files generated by **sf3dmodels** and load them within the LIME environment. 
To invoke this option, a ``-S`` flag (uppercase) must be added in the usual LIME running command as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   lime -S model.c

The standard LIME command line options may also be invoked. For instance, to set LIME to 
(1.) produce normal output rather than the default ncurses output style, (2.)  
read the **sf3dmodels** output and (3.) run in parallel mode with 4 threads 
you should execute:

.. code-block:: bash

   lime -nS -p 4 model.c


**Note** that if the ``-S`` option *is not set* you will get back the 'traditional' operation of LIME.

LIME Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Take a look at the folders **lime/example** and **lime/example_sf3dmodels/** included in the package repository.
